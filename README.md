# SNHU CS250: SNHU Travel Project

The SNHU Travel Project is a dynamic, Agile-driven application developed as part of the CS250 coursework. This project demonstrates the application of Agile methodologies by incorporating iterative development, continuous user feedback, and a structured approach to software development.

## Introduction
In this project, Agile methodology played a central role in transforming user requirements into working software. I embraced the principles of iterative development, continuous feedback, and cross-functional roles to simulate a full Scrum team environment.

### Agile Methodology
- **Iterative Process:** We iteratively developed features through sprints, allowing constant refinement.
- **User Stories:** Each feature was driven by specific user stories to ensure alignment with user needs.
- **Scrum Roles:** I managed Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developer responsibilities, which helped prioritize the product backlog, remove impediments, and deliver working increments.

## Project Overview
The SNHU Travel Project facilitates personalized travel planning by allowing users to:
- Search for destinations by budget, interest, and location.
- Receive real-time updates (e.g., travel restrictions) integrated within the sprint process.
- Experience a user-centric design achieved through continuous feedback and iterations.

This project illustrates the effective use of Agile practices to adapt to changing requirements and user needs continuously.
